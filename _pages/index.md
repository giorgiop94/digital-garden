# Welcome! ðŸŒ±

This is my attempt to play around with a digital garden.

Here I'll be sharing some of the notes that I put together in my various explorations of the interweb.

Some of the topics I'm most interested in are [[Meditation]] (particularly I've been following [[Rob Burbea]]'s teachings), [[Ecology]], Communities and Decentralized Organizing.

Some other (kinda) polished notes I made:
- [[Taoism]]
- [[Planetary Boundaries]]


Feel free to dive into any of those rabbit holes, and if there's anything you want to discuss, my [DMs are open on Twitter (@giorgiop_)](https://twitter.com/giorgiop_). Say hi! ðŸ‘‹

If you want to check some of my essays, instead, you can do so on [giorgiop.com](http://giorgiop.com/)
