# Welcome! ðŸŒ±

This is my attempt to play and experiment with a digital garden.

Here I'll be sharing some of the notes that I put together in my various explorations. Most of these notes are meant for my personal use on [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), so they might not be super polished or some formatting may be sub-optimal.

I put my notes together using my own undefined variation of [Nick Milo's LYT (Linking Your Thinking) framework](https://www.linkingyourthinking.com/).

Some of the topics I'm most interested in right now are [[Meditation]] (particularly I've been following [[Rob Burbea]]'s teachings), [[Regeneration]], Communities and Decentralized Organizing.

Below are some rudimentary MOCs (Maps of Content) that could be fun to explore:
- [[Taoism]]
- [[Planetary Boundaries]]
- [[Resilience]]
- [[Decision-Making]]
- [[Fear]]


If there's anything you want to discuss, or you have any feedback, feel free to [DM me](https://twitter.com/giorgiop_). Say hi! ðŸ‘‹
