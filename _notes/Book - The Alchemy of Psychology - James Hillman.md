title: Book - The Alchemy of Psychology - James Hillman 
---
Alchemy not to be taken literally. It offers another way (metaphorical) way to talk about the psyche. Talking alchemically is therapeutic, it frees from imagining yourself as a damaged self, ego, etc... 

In alchemy, you know you're talking in metaphors. In psychology, the language is literalized, which becomes more oppressive 

"We call reality the fantasy we don't see as a fantasy" 


# Materia Prima
- Color: Undifferentiated (grey, beige)
	- Nothing is clear
	- In alchemy black is an achievement

### Massa Confusa
- represent the initial psychological state/frame. When in massa confusa you should not use the sword, because you'd be killing all the seeds of potential that are within you
	- you need a vessel big enough to hold the whole massa confusa, including the parts of yourself you think you don't like
	- we might be tempted to act immediately - the hero needs to act - and diagnose the problem
- inertia and desire to stay just the way you are - mass as something that resists change
	- to be confused is to be inert (there's no direction)

### Ugly, Despicable Face
- How many times have we been ashamed of our face?
- How long can we stare in the mirror?
	- shame of one's own ugliness
- There might be something essentially shameful about how we look
	- not only social, conditioned by society and parents
- There's a call toward beauty
	- the soul tends towards beauty

### Other Examples
- Inner fire
- Slime of the small world
	- petty things in life, gossip etc...
- Pitch - sticky blackness that sticks to everything
	- everything that looked great yesterday now looks bad 
	- worry as a pitch  that keeps you stuck
		- worry about where you are

## Where does Materia Prima come from?
It is uncaused - it comes out of itself. Radix Ipsius (root of itself)

- In psychology, everything needs to be explained by something else (childhood, parents, poverty, trauma). 
- This alchemical view, allows each individual to have its own destiny. You do not have to conceive yourself in terms of a personal biography, you are the cause of yourself. 
	- Only the self can create the self [[Carl Jung]]
	- We're made by imagination, not by personal history.
