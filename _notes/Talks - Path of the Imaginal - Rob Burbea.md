## Talk 1 - Doorways and Directions
### Cultural Attitudes Towards Images
- Historically lots of denigration of imagination
	- Socrates, Dante, and Descartes had recurring images coming up and were made fun of
- Images are seen as unhealthy or crazy by the scientific reductionist model
	- Even psychology is mostly coming from the medical model
		- Imagination seen as something to be transcended after childhood
	- Secular mindfulness culture today is relying on this model as well

**These attitudes contribute to many of our unconscious beliefs**

#### Ranges of Imaginal Practices
- Creative planning and visioning
- Develop certain skills or rehearse (sports, music, etc...)
- Self-improvement
- Buddhism
	- Contemplation of death (in cemetery or imagination)
	- Recollection of the Buddha (to deal with hindrances, spark inspiration)
	- Deities that spark metta or other qualities
- Psychotherapeutic Approaches
	- Internal Family Systems
		- Images seen as part of ourselves that need to be integrated
		- Not desirable to have images be more powerful than self

### What Practice Are We Talking About?
- Not so much about the images themselves, but more about our relationship with the images, our conceptual framework about them
- Opening the range to all kinds of images
	- From the angelic, loving ones to the more disturbing ones
- What is imaginal practice in the service of?
	- What am I allowing images to be in the service of?
		- That's up to each practitioner
		- For Rob, it is opening up a whole new conception and sense of existence, of the self, others etc..
- The practice and our sensibility get subtler and subtler with time

### Common Resistance to Imaginal Practice
1. It is going to make you crazy
	- Gets you out of touch with reality
	- Fragments your self
2. Inability to question cultural beliefs
	- [[Ontology]] → Images not seen as real
	- [[Epistemiology]] → Imagination not trustworthy
	- Cosmology
3. Imagination may invite us to go beyond the classical Dharma paradigm of ending suffering
4. Images that arise or are heard do not fit in the person's idea of Dharma
	- Erotic images, unusual archetypes etc...
5. Multiplicity of self being given an equal validity and sense of beauty can be scary

### Imaginal to Update/Upgrade our Practice
- Imaginal may legitimize aspects of life that had been put aside or repressed
	- Eros, trickster quality, divine madness
- As we practice we realize that fantasy and image imbue our lives anyway, and imbue our Dharma
- Our notion of self is very different from that at the time of the Buddha
	- No reference to struggles with the [[Inner Critic]], repression, self-expression, feeling seen or heard in the Pali Canon

#### Confused Relationship of Self
- Mainstream culture celebrates and highlights the self
- Spiritual circles often denigrate the [[Ego]]
- **We're not honoring personhood as fully as it would be possible**
- We are accustomed to singularity of self
	- In this practice we open a plurality of self, beyond the simple recognition of multiple selves (sometimes found in [[anatta]] and the teachings of not-self)
		- Not just recognizing the many characters within ourselves
	- **We can empower and bring to life these characters**
	- **We open a flexibility of self view and world view**
		- [[Emptiness]] becomes easier to get to


## Talk 2 - Doorways and Directions
What we're interested with this practice is **expanding our felt sense of sacredness and re-enchant the cosmos**

- Re-validating imagination as a "way of knowing"

### Areas of Differentiation from Other Imaginal Frameworks
1. Throrough sense of [[Emptiness of self]]
	- Expand the range of Self
	- Turn around our relationship with figures
	- Is there a place for divinity in the self of me and others?
		- Different from the divinity talked about in [[Oneness]]
		- It's particular. Each personality as it expresses right now has its **divinity**
2. Realization that fantasy and image already permeates our life
	- Not a bad thing
	- We see, think and love through image, fantasy and mythos
	- Is there a different way of conceiving the Dharma given that realization?
3. Cosmopoesis
	- Using the imagination to open up the sense and perception of the world we live in
	- Malleability of perception of the cosmos
4. Including and nourishing Soulfulness 
	- Expansion of what we consider beautiful and meaningful
	- Expansion of range of Self
5. Giving validity to Imagination as a "way of knowing"
	

### Conceptions of the Dharma
- Popular Dharma
	- This is it - Only the present moment exists
	- Try not to cling and let go
	- Try to be kind
- Advaita
	- Everything is one
	- No-Self

### Rob's Proposed Conception
- All the ones above are [[Ways of Looking]] to take on and put down
- Dharma is the practice of this flexibility in lookings
	- We realize that what we perceive depends on the way we look
- Turn towards "Hermaneutics"
	- Realizing that we are already (and always) bringing interpretations, biases into our perception of history
	- "There is no single objective story of the Buddha"
	- Our vision of the Buddha is imbued by fantasy
- Expanding the conception of the [[Four Noble Truths]]
	- Seeing them as keys to examine experiences, perceptions and reveal their emptiness
	- Help us widen our range of ways of looking

## Talk 3 - Energy Body Instructions (Part 1)
Guided meditation starts at approximately minute 24:00- 1:06:00

3 types of mindfulness of the body
1. Mindfulness of sensations (traditional)
2. Mindfulness of materiality of the body 
	- Contemplating death, the body's decomposing, impermanent nature and its parts (teeth, hair, tissues, fat, liver etc...) 
	- Includes imagination and conceptions of the body
3. Mindfulness of the [[Energy Body]]
	- Not a new age claim about energy or aura
	- A mode of sensing the body
		- No knowledge is required to feel it (while for the materiality of the body you need to know about organs etc...)
	- Giving attention to an area slightly bigger than the body
		- Paying attention to the texture, sensations, vibrations in this field
		- If you're sitting on a chair, it includes the area beneath the chair
	- Keeping a playful, experimenting attitude
	- Breath may or may not be involved

### Why Emphasize the Energy Body
- Energy body practice develops [[Samadhi]], filling us up with well-being
- Sensitivity to energy body 
	- makes us more aware of emotions and gives us a way to work with difficult emotions
	- Allows us to pick up on the resonance of different images (discern which images are helpful for soulmaking)
		- If I'm not in touch with the body I'm just daydreaming

## Talk 4 - Energy, Image, Emotion (Part 1)
### Intention of Samadhi
- Using the energy body to cultivate states of well-being
	- Even if subtle
	- Allowing ourselves to enjoy
- No need to let the [[Inner Critic]] measure how well we're doing depending on how much pleasure we feel
	- **Seeing this practice as an act of kindness, like taking a warm bath**
	- We wouldn't judge ourselves if we don't relax "enough" during the bath
- Keeping a playful and experimental attitude
	- Let's see if I'd feel better by adjusting the breath this way
	- (Just like during your bath, you might fine tune the warmth of water)
- Awareness will tend to shrink
	- Developing sensibility to it shrinking and expanding it again
- [[Dealing with Pain in Meditation]]

### Attention to Emotions
Developing Emotional awareness and learning to work skillfully with emotions

#### What we try to do with Emotions
1. Increase our sensitivity to emotions, opening to the richness, and depth of our heart
	- Including the nuances
	- Senses of sacredness, boredom may all be quite subtle
2. We want to be able to handle what happens in our heart
	- Both what is difficult and what is pleasant (intense joy)
	- Both emotions that come from our personal life and from the state of the world
3. Cultivating fruitful, beautiful qualities of heart (love, joy, gratitude, generosity)
	- And learning to let go the unfruitful
	- Doesn't mean to only tend to the pleasant. Sometimes paying attention to unpleasant emotions can be fruitful
4. Sensitivity to emotions forms an important part of Imaginal practice
5. Understanding our personal patterns and habits
	- Dependent arising of emotions

#### Not "Just Being" with Emotions
- We pay attention to the mid-line of the body, from perineum to top of the head
- Making sure energy of mindfulness is stronger than that of emotions
	- Otherwise we sink into the emotion without realizing it
- **The qualities within the attention are of huge importance, they might help or worsen what's going on**
	- Is there judgment and aversion, or gentleness, kindness etc...
	- Asking ourselves "Is this helpful?" If not, we may fine-tune our attention
- [[Working with the Hindrances]]
	- Deliberately bringing up loving, helpful images that help
		- Love may feel bigger than the body
		- We can feel the whole body bathed in love
	- Sometimes they can arise spontaneously
	- Imaginal figures can be incredibly loving, healing and can help Samadhi to develop

## Talk 5 - Energy, Image, Emotion (Part 2)
### Difficult Emotions
- Difficult Emotions have energy in them, but that energy is caught/trapped in an unhelpful vortex.
	- If an image arises with the difficult emotion, it may help to harmonize the energy

#### The example of Anger
- Anger is not the same as ill-will
	- Ill-will involves the want for someone to suffer
	- Anger sometimes includes ill-will but doesn't need to
- [[Anger]] has a lot of energy in it
	- Sometimes if someone feels angry but low-energy or depressed, it may be because energy is not being recognized or allowed to be felt
	- If the anger is allowed, the energy body can expand and increase the energy ([[Feeling Through Emotions]])
		- For example an image of a warrior might arise
	- Then it is not an afflictive emotion anymore, it can be used as creative energy

#### Low-Energy Default Groove
- The state of low energy and slight depression may become the default in some cases
	- You don't even realize you're in it, it became so normal
- Sometimes it could be caused by some sort of energy not being recognized (anger, eros, libido)

#### Assumptions About Emotions
- If we're attentive to our reactions to emotions we may find our assumptions about them
- We might assume that emotions are just papancha
- Or We might assume that emotions are sacrosant
	- That they always reveal the truth
	- We must respect them, be with them and not try to change them
- We might always want to know why a certain emotion is there
	- Sometimes it's helpful and we can know why
	- Sometimes we can't know why
	- To always seek a reason puts too much pressure

### Images and Emotions
- **Image can hold more than just an emotion**
	- Many shades of emotions, sense of soulfulness, beauty, depth, duty
	- With this practice we're interested in **expanding the range**
		- Of emotions and images that are meaningful and beautiful to us
- Usually with anger we are lost in the object
	- All the energy is directed towards the object (often with ill-will)
	- We're not aware of ourselves and our energy
- In imaginal practice, there could be anger but not as much concerned with an object (without ill-will)
	- e.g. A raging warrior fighting, but the enemy is not a big part of the image

### What is Primary?
- Energy, image, and emotion all dependently co-arise, none of them is primary
- The views that I have of images, emotions, energy affect how things unfold
- Can I play with different views?
	- Meditation is the practice of ways of looking
	- This reveals the [[Emptiness]] of perceptions, which brings more and more freedom
	- [[non-clinging]] in Buddhism not as a way of living, but non-clinging to any one [[Ways of Looking]]

## Talk 6 - Energy Body Instructions (Part 2)
- Developing sensitivity to the energy body helps us
	- Cultivate Samadhi
	- Enable us to work with difficult emotions
	- Develop emotional and energetic sensitivity for all practices (metta, insight, imaginal etc..)

### Emotional Awareness Via Energy Body
- Developing sensitivity to subtle emotions (boredom, peace)
- Cultivating the positive qualities of heart and letting go of the negative
- Learning to handle both the difficult and positive emotions
	- Not just being with them, but also helping it dissolve
- Witnessing the [[dependent co-arising]] of emotions

### Practice
- Keeping energy body in the background
- Paying attention to emotions in the vertical mid-line of the body in the foreground
- Giving steady, light attention to whatever is happening in the mid-line
- We can wrap the emotions in the well-being and kindness of samadhi
	- **Healing happens in the contact of the beautiful and helpful with the difficult**
- The energy of attention needs to be stronger than that of emotions

- Paying attention also to the quality of attention and views
	- Keeping a gentle, holding quality of attention
	- Holding attention even when it seems like there are no emotions
	- What are my views? (e.g. "I shouldn't be feeling this, If I don't feel anything I'm not a good meditator")
		- **Play with switching the view** ("whatever I'm feeling right now is perfect")
		- Any emotion is fertile ground for imaginal practice

#### Practicing Allowing
- Lessening of aversion and clinging are central to the practice
- Making a practice of allowing
	- First getting intimate with whatever sensation is there
	- Opening the door, welcoming them as fully as possible
		- Shift in energetic relationship with emotions
		- Continuous process
- Allowing is a way of practicing, not a way of living



## Talk 7 - What Is an Image? (Part 1)
- Images are not necessarily visual
	- Can be auditory, kinestetic
- "Images" may talk to us and share their wisdom
	- But the point is not so much on the dialogue even though it can be helpful
	- More emphasis on the images themselves, that can be full of meaningfulness
- Images may not only arise in meditation but anywhere, at any time

### Meaningfulness, Not Meaning
- Images are not things to be deciphered, or to be explained
- They are more like **poetic images**
	- Deep, inexhaustible, not reducible to a single meaning
	- They are open and ambiguous, there'es a mystery to it
		- That helps to keep them alive for us
	- There's a poetic truth to it, not to be taken literal
- We are not necessarily after striking visual images
	- But in Soulfulness
	- Images that embody certain qualities in a deep sense and how they relate to us (love, strength, intimacy etc...)

### Narrative and Iconic Images
- Narrative images unfold like a story, they are more dynamic
- Iconic images stay as they are without evolving so much in a temporal or causal, sequential fashion
	- Timelessness to them
- They are on a spectrum, not clearly defined
- In this practice we lean more towards iconic ones
- Some images are more ethereal, less substantial, some more earthy

### Repeating & Pacing
- **Most images need repeating**
	- Gradually we develop a different sensitivity and conception (of self, practice, the world)
	- Like listening to songs we love again and again
- Pacing
	- We want to dwell and focus on images that come up
	- Not daydreaming and drifting from one to another

### Archetypal Images
- How Jung defines [[Archetypes]]
	- > “Archetypes are typical forms of behaviour which … naturally present themselves as ideas and images. By way of these effects, we discover that they have an organizing influence on the contents of consciousness.” [[Carl Jung]]
	- An archetype is not an image, but what shapes images
		- You don't meet one clear, single archetype
		- > “The fact is that the single archetypes are not isolated from each other, but are in a state of contamination of the most complete mutual interpenetration and interfusion."
- [[James Hillman]] instead talks about "**viewing an image as archetypal**"
	- > Any image termed ‘archetypal’ is immediately valued as universal, trans-historical, basically profound, generative, highly intentional, and necessary.
	- **The relationship with the image is part of the archetypal nature**
	- The [[Ways of Looking]] are included in the way we intend the word "image" 


## Talk 8 - What Is an Image? (Part 2)
- Images are alive
	- They are autonomous in some ways
	- They are not just a part of me that I can control
- Images can cross-pollinate, they're fertile
	- There's nothing wrong with integrating myths, other people's images and more into our images
	- The psyche is creative and opportunistic and takes experiences from our life

### Divinity & What's Real
- Entertaining the view that images are rooted in the divine
- If we speak of Gods, we are creating these gods
	- We are fabricating them in our psyche, yet they are in some way real
	- Neither real nor not real
- Images always dependently co-arise with the [[Ways of Looking]]
	- Not yet an "image" in the way we mean it unless we have a sort of relationship to it
	- **We're playing with conceptual frameworks**
- What if we don't dismiss the images as neurons firing in our brain, but we don't either literalize it and interpret it too rigidly?

### Differences with Papancha
- "Images" are imbued with meaningfulness, timelessness, beauty, depth
	- They are expansive, connected to the energy body
- In papancha, we can also assign a lot of energy and significance to memories
	- Images just mean what we think they mean, they are small concretized, there's no depth and beauty
	- The ego is wrapped up in them
	- There's contraction of the psyche and energy body
