	- [[Noble Eightfold Path]]
-  [[Meditation]]
	- Samadhi (concentration)
	- Vipassana (insight) 
	- [[Metta -Loving Kindness- Meditation]]

- Nibbana (the goal of the path)
	- The cessation of fabrications of the mind

### 2. Mahayana
- [[Emptiness]]
- Compassion
Ideal: Bodhisattva → Being who wants to awaken all other beings

### 3. Vajrayana (Tibetan Tradition)

	- [[Buddhist Tantra]]
 
 ### Finding a home in Buddhism
![[Book - Approaching Vajrayana - David Chapman#Person-Yana Fit]]

### Not the path of "just letting be"/no striving
> By him who knows not, who sees not as it really is (the causal uprising and ceasing) . . . training must be done . . . practice must be done . . . exertion must be made . . . there must be no turning back. . . there must be energy. . . there must be mindfulness . . . there must be earnestness. - Samyutta Nikdya, read in [[Mutual Causality in Buddhism and General Systems Theory by Joanna Macy]]

 
 ## Critiques
### David Chapman on Consensus Buddhism

![[Buddhist Tantra#Mainstream Buddhism and Tantra]]

 #### Vague Path to Save All Beings
- Bodhisattvayana—the Buddhist path of compassion:
	1. Compassion
	2. ???
	3. Save all sentient beings!

#### Rejection of Power
- Power is needed if we want to create change in the World for the good of all
	- Like any tool, power can be used for good or ill
