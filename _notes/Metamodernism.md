## Transcending Paradigms is the Highest Leverage Point (Meadows)
> There is yet one leverage point that is even higher than changing a paradigm. That is to **keep oneself unattached in the arena of paradigms, to stay flexible, to realize that no paradigm is “true,” that every one, including the one that sweetly shapes your own worldview, is a tremendously limited understanding of an immense and amazing universe that is far beyond human comprehension** 

## Science
From [[Joseph Tainter]] et al: [Dragnet Ecology—“Just the Facts, Ma’am”: The Privilege
of Science in a Postmodern WorldDragnet Ecology—“Just the Facts, Ma’am”: The Privilege of Science in a Postmodern World](https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/51/6/475/240648)

> The postmodern ([[Postmodernism]]) world denies science the privilege of being objective. But that does not and should not mean science has lost its privilege as something that should be taken more seriously than most other human endeavors

> We need new myths for new times, and the myth of the fair-minded, evenhanded journalist is as inappropriate as the myth of science finding the truth.

> Instead of retreating to naive objectivism, scientists need to adapt to a postmodern age by becoming conscious of the significance of their narratives. Reconceptualizing science and scientific privilege at the science–policy interface is not just exciting, it is necessary
