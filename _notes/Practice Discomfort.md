Idea from [[Stoicism]] about intentionally putting oneself in uncomfortable conditions for a certain amount of time.

Twofold gains:
- You stop fearing hypothetical futures because you experienced them and know you can bear them
	- Most fear is [[fear of the unknown]], but once you experience it is not unknown anymore
	- You learn that you can adapt to pretty much anything
- You appreciate more what you normally have
