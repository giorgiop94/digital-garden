### Soil Ecosystem Services
- Healthy soils sequester carbon and use it to foster its microorganisms
	- **Soil can sequester more carbon than plants and atmosphere combined**
	- Rich soils produce more nutrient rich food
- Damaged soils release carbon dioxide and water
	- Turns soil into dust (desertification)
- No-till soil absorbs more water and carbon (improves water cycle)

### Modern Agriculture is not Designed for Soil (or Human) Health
- Tilling reduces soil's biodiversity and makes soil release carbon
	- The more tilling, the worse the soils, the more farmers use pesticides and fertilizers
- Pesticides kill microorganisms in the soils, in the food and in our microbiome

### Practices for Healthy Soils
- Composting
- No tillage
- Perennials
- Cover crops
- Plant diversity
- Special types of grazing and other animals' involvement
