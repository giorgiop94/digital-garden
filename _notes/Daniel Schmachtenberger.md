	- if you're not outraged you're not paying attention
	- if you're not overwhelmed by the beauty of life you're not paying attention
		- the outrage comes from the care for the beauty and wanting to preserve it
		- if I'm always outraged I'm not connected to the beauty and unable to honor it
		- how can we be with the beauty of life while working to try to preserve this beauty for future generations?
