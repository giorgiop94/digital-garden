title: Ways of Looking
---

- [[non-clinging]] in Buddhism not as a way of living, but non-clinging to any one way of looking

### Notes from Podcast on Emerge with Rob Burbea
Link: https://castbox.fm/vb/90761812

-  We always go about our lives with a **frame, view, conception** on reality
-  Phenomenological approach - Pay attention to appearances in consciousness
    -  Everything else is an assumption on top of that
    -  What can I discover in meditation about experiences
-  Mindfulness - Simply watching experiences
    -  Stop spinning stories
	-  This is often explained as **REALITY**
    -  Rob sees this as another assumption
        -  You can develop and play with different ways of looking at perception
		-  What happens when you reject/chase experiences?
		-  Or when you relax?

-  **[[Meditation]] as an infinite playground of infinite ways of looking at experience**
    -  We can get skillful at this
    -  Some ways of looking create more ease, some more dis-ease
    -  Experiment how different ways of looking affect your sense of Self and your sense of the World
- Some people will accept that there are different ways of looking, but also think that we should eventually come back to "reality" and that there is such thing
- **[[Emptiness]]** in Buddhism can be interpreted as:
    - All things without exception (including space and time and awareness) is empty of existing independent of the way you look at it
- Maybe there is an independent reality, maybe there isn't

- To add: Raft story: put down the teachings, just like ways of looking
