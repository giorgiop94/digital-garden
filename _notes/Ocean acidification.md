One of the Earth's [[Planetary Boundaries]], measured in terms of Aragonite saturation (a measure of carbonate ion concentration.)

### Chemistry
![Oceean Acidification](https://usa.oceana.org/sites/default/files/acidification_chemistry_chart_3.jpg)

- Part of he carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere gets absorbed by the Oceans
- Carbon absorbed by oceans make the ph of water more acid

### Consequences
- Acidification causes faster calcification of marine organisms (coral reef become colorless calcium-looking things)
- Other organisms also do not thrive in acid ocean

### Other ocean stressors
- Ocean warming
- Ocean pollution

### Connections
- Driven by carbon dioxide (just like [[Climate change]]
- Chemical pollution comes from food production [[Food Systems]]
