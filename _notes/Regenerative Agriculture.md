## What is regenerative agriculture?
- Regenerative Agriculture helps to build soils
- Regenerative Agriculture is a continuum → From very degenerative (destructive) to more regenerative

#### Regenerative Agriculture Practices
From [[Paper - Food in the Anthropocene the EAT–Lancet Commission]]
>  incorporating farm organic wastes into soil, low or no tillage, nitrogen-fixing cover plants, replacement of annuals with perennial crops and pastures, agroforestry, establishing buffer strips, and keeping some farmland with natural vegetation.
	
### Characteristics of regen ag 
- High Diversity, Resilience, Local
- Little waste and pollution, no tillage
- [[soil health is essential]]

### Self-Reliance Revolution
From [Podcast - A Quiet Boycott with David Holmgren (For The Wild Podcast)](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4sheDC3SI24rH5chc7X8Bf?si=f131da3f3dc44847)

- **Individual acts in the form of self-reliance may be more successful than any policy ever could**
	- Being dependent on and benefiting from the systems we are embedded in, we are also complicit
		- Embodying our radical ideas in our own lives can be much more powerful than demanding changes
		- We prove they can work
- Any complex system that works has evolved from a simpler system, we can start setting the foundations for the systems we want to live in
- **Given the crises affecting the world, self-reliance may make sense any way**
- It would be a huge strike of labor, consumption and capital with the power of being noticed

### Risks of Investing in Extractive Agriculture
1. High and volatile input costs
	- Most farmers are profitable thanks to subsidies
	- Last 5 years, input prices increased by 20%, output prices by 5%
		- Intensive animal producers are the most affected from high feed costs 
2. Negative externalities
	- Value of property decreasing
	- Soils quality and future cashflows decrease
3. Vulnerable to climate change
4. Health and consumer preferences
5. Biodiversity Loss

### Returns of Regenerative Agriculture
1. Comparable or higher yields
	- Many examples of agroforestry outcompeting monocrop 
2. Lower operating cost (possibility)
	- No need for expensive fertilizers or seeds
	- **Farming is a margin's business**
		- Yield not always a good indicator of profitability 
3. Increasing value of capital
4. Healthy soils are more resilient
	- Less susceptible to pest infestations etc... 
5. Positive externalities
	- Nascent market and possibilities to get paid
		- Nori, Soil heroes, Regen Network
6. Higher price (50-200%)

### Impact of Regenerative Agriculture
Impact investors are looking for the highest possible positive net impact

1. Healthy soils and forests (agroforestry) sequester carbon
2. Water Storage
3. Healthy soils encourage biodiversity
4. Healthy soils, healthy microbiomes, healthy people
