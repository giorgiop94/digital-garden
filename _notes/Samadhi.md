A state of energized calmness, a unification of body and mind

Samadhi is on a spectrum, you can have more or less at any given time. It is not a specific state to reach.


## Cultivating Well Being
### Positive Feedback Loops
- Cultivating Samadhi, we cultivate states with less and less fabrication. Less and less Self. Thus we create fertile soil for insight into [[Emptiness]]
	- Insight, also helps cultivating states of Samadhi
- Samdhi supports Happiness and vice-versa

### For the Good of All Beings
- **==Creating a reservoir of pleasure and well being in practice allows us to let go and renounce material things==**
- It gives us the ability to refuse
	- **It's hard to escape the system when you're addicted to its products**
	- Psychologically and emotionally we can fill ourselves with well-being
- You can drench yourself in love, peace and well-being at will 
- You can get to the edge of burnout, and get in this place of energy and peace
- We can encounter the pain of the world with an open heart
- Ethical behavior encourages states of well-being
	- True happiness lies in living a virtuous life
