## Intro
- Not supposed to give a sudden shift or realization
- 5 preliminary exercises for Soul-Making Dharma
	- No prescribed order
	- Preliminaries to these
		- Mindfulness
		- Energy Body awareness

### Why these exercises?
- Developing Sensitivity
	- To voice, energy body, movement etc...
- Learn to stop holding ourselves back
	- We habitually hold back our eros, our soul, libido etc...
		- Very common in some Dharma cultures
		- Certain images won't arise if we hold ourselves back
	- We might encounter resistance to these exercises (very normal)
		- That's part of this holding back
- Make movement, gestures, voice "insouled"
	- If the soul wants to express itself through those, it can
		- Developing the "Art of Movement and Gesture"
	- Movements can be "sensed with Soul"
		- Sensed as "Angelic, Divine, Unfathomable"


## 5 Exercises
- They can all be done physically or in the energy body
	- 4 Postures: Sitting, standing, walking or lying down
- Not meant to be done exclusively or obsessively
	- "Middle Way" approach
	- Integrating them in one's practice
### 1. Developing Sensitivity of Energy Body
- Adopt the posture
- Feel the energy body
- 5 Stages
	1. Allow the energy body feeling to extend to fill the room and touch the walls, ceilings, floor
	2. Slowly move hands, wrists and arms while feeling the energy body and feeling (sensing and imagining) like you're pushing water, or air
	3.  Move your head and neck (you can decide to stop arms and hands or continue)
	4.  Legs and ankles start moving (you can decide to stop the rest or continue)
	5.  Moving the whole body
-  **The intention is to develop sensitivity of the expanded energy body**
-  You can play around with different speeds
	-  Probably better to start slower

### 2. Voice/Energy Body Exercises
- Feel energy body awareness
- Sound extended notes for a long time (not getting out of breath)
	- Play with your full range
1. **Where in the energy body is the center of the sound?**
	- Start focusing on the center line from head to perineum
	- Can you feel sound coming from arms and legs?
	- Can you feel it from other parts of the energy body?
2. Can you feel sound from the whole energy body?
3. At some point you might reach a stage where the energy body is the sound and viceversa
4. Can the sound/energy body fill the room you're in?
		- Not necessarily need to get louder (sometimes useful to get louder though)
- You can make actual sounds or imagine them

### 3. Set of Five
#### 1. ThunderClap
1. Emphatic, sudden movement with or without vocalization
	- Power, Strength in the movement
	- Consolidate mind, body, intention
		- Bring everything together
		- This is the hard part 
	- Can be a kick, karate chop, step etc...
		- Can be rehearsed or spontaneous
	- **Rob sees this as the most important exercise**
		- Ability to gather the mind and body into one congruent movement is rare
2. Assessment Aspect
	- Teacher or friend to watch thunderclap
		- Student to self-assess (conguence, energy etc...)
#### 2. Born aloft by Angels
- 2 Minutes Max
- Express with your body the image of being Born aloft by Angels
	- Body is floating, weightless
	- It can give itself to be brought by angels
	- Body becomes fluid while **surrendering**

#### 3. Raging Beast
- No limit on the image/appearance of the Beast
	- Beast doesn't imply evil or ill will
- 30 Seconds to 2 minutes total
- Feel bursts of letting this beast come through your body
	- Or you can let it for the whole time

#### 4. Immovable Guardian
- Maybe human, maybe not
- What are they protecting?
	- Maybe the Earth, maybe some social justice
- Express image in your stance, posture, gestures or posture
- 30 Seconds to 2 minutes total

#### 5. The Serpent
- No instructions given
- 30 Seconds to 2 minutes total
### 4. Dyad Exercises
- Set up the space and connect with yourself
- One person blesses the other for ~10 minutes
	- Through gestures and vocalization (can't use any known language)
		- Convey blessings without language (can include singing)
		- You can also do just movement, or just vocalizations
	- Can be fast or slow, with pauses
	- Can play with images, embodying different images (of oneself, the other or more)
- The other person's task is silent sensitivity
	- Open the whole energy body to the other and their blessing
	- Notice what happens in energy body and emotions
- The meanings of the word "blessing" can grow

- Variation: Drop any idea of attempt to convey any meaning, emotion, image
- Just movement, gesture and voice
