> Trying to define yourself is like trying to bite your own teeth. - [[Alan Watts]]

## Who is Your Self?
> Who is Your Self?
You, The Universe? Depends on your perspective
What is conflict at one **level of magnification**, is harmony at another level
Space and bodies in the space are two aspects of the same continuum, you cannot get one without the other

From [[Book - Thinking in Systems - Donella Meadows]]
> You can see some things through the lens of the human eye, other things through the lens of a microscope, others through the lens of a telescope, and still others through the lens of systems theory. Everything seen through each kind of lens is actually there. Each way of seeing allows our knowledge of the wondrous world in which we live to become a little more complete.

## Different Views

### Self As Consciousness

You are consciousness, awareness, the observer of your mind.

- Your mind is simply a mix of all the conditioning that you've received since birth and memories that you accumulated. It thinks thoughts that it already heard somewhere else ([[your thoughts are not yours]]). If you were born somewhere else you'd have different thoughts, a totally different mind. So that cannot be you.
- The real you is the awareness behind it. Consciousness.

### Self as dynamic process
Self as a fluid, everchanging process

> “I live on Earth at present, and I don’t know what I am. I know that I am not a category. I am not a thing — a noun. I seem to be a verb, an evolutionary process – an integral function of the universe.”
	– [Buckminster Fuller](http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Buckminster_Fuller)

You can shape your self
- [[Small actions change your self-identity]]
- [[Positive Self-Talk]]

### Self as Empty
- However we define ourselves, our definition is not going to ALWAYS hold true
	- If it is not always true, we cannot say it to be true 

- **==Emptiness of Self doesn't mean there's an erasure of personality==**
	- Are we moving to normalcy and conformity?
	- **==Emptiness means we are free to express our individuality==**

## Provocative Quotes

> "If the voice in your head is you, who’s the one listening to it?"
— Byron Katie

> "The Aubrey is always worrying about something. The Aubrey is an identity construct. It’s not a real thing. The body is real, the unborn and undying consciousness that animates the Aubrey is a real thing. But the Aubrey is just an idea, reinforced by the environment that affirms that idea." [[Aubrey Marcus]]
