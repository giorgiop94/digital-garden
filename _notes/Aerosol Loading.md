Aerosol = liquid droplets or particles suspended in the atmosphere

Changing the atmosphere's chemistry risks creating unexpected [[tipping points]]

Not one general boundary defined, but a strong case to define sub-boundaries for different types of aerosol 

## Functions of Aerosol
- Absorb and reflect light
	- Regulate heat balance
- Help condensation
	- Affect cloud formation and rainfall
- Influence atmosphere chemistry

## Sources of Aerosol
### Natural Sources
- Ocean waves bubble bursting
	- microcrystals of salt ejected in the air
- Fire
- Volacanoes
- Vegetation emits tiny compounds that react in the atmosphere

### Human Sources
- Industrial smoke emissions
- Urban emissions
- Land use change and deforestation
