- In the past 2000 years, during the [[Geological Ages#Holocene 10 000 years| Holocene]] temperatures varied a maximum of +/- 1 degrees
- Over the past 150 years there was a stark increase in global temperatures
	- We already increased temperatures by over ~1 degree

### Second Order Effects
- Melting of ice packs
	- Sea levels rise
	- Increased heat absorption by the Earth


### Risk of [[Tipping point (nonlinear) effects]] has been increasing dramatically
- The Earth's [[Resilience]] is decreasing
- Science indicates that at the range of between 350 ppm and 450 ppm (of carbon dioxide) we have a risk of crossing catastrophic thresholds
