- In the past 2000 years, during the [[Geological Ages#Holocene 10 000 years| Holocene]] temperatures varied a maximum of +/- 1 degrees
- Over the past 150 years there was a stark increase in global temperatures
	- We already increased temperatures by over ~1 degree

### Second Order Effects
- Melting of ice packs
	- Sea levels rise
	- Increased heat absorption by the Earth


### Risk of Tipping point (nonlinear) effects has been increasing dramatically
- The Earth's [[Resilience]] is decreasing
- Science indicates that at the range of between 350 ppm and 450 ppm (of carbon dioxide) we have a risk of crossing catastrophic thresholds

### Temperature Scenarios
![[IPCC Scenarios(August 21 Report).png]]

### Effects
> B.2 Many changes in the climate system become larger in direct relation to increasing global warming. They include increases in the frequency and intensity of **hot extremes**, marine heatwaves, and **heavy precipitation**, agricultural and **ecological droughts** in some regions, and proportion of intense tropical cyclones, as well as reductions in Arctic sea ice, snow cover and permafrost
> B.5 Many changes due to past and future greenhouse gas emissions are **irreversible for centuries to millennia**, especially changes in the **ocean, ice sheets** and global sea level
	> upper ocean stratification (virtually certain), ocean acidification (virtually certain) and ocean deoxygenation (high confidence) will continue to increase in the 21st century, at rates dependent on future emissions. Changes are irreversible on centennial to millennial time scales 
	> It is virtually certain that global mean sea level will continue to rise over the 21st century.

> D 1.6 If global net negative CO2 emissions were to be achieved and be sustained, the global CO2-induced surface temperature increase would be gradually reversed but other climate changes would continue in their current direction for decades to millennia (high confidence)
