## Main Concepts
- [[Ways of Looking]]
	- There are different ways of looking available to us which unfold different existences
	- Any way of looking is fabricating reality
- [[Emptiness]]
- [[Goals in Spiritual Practice]]
- [[Pitfalls of Spiritual Frameworks]]

- **Our Modernist Worldview has impregnated the Dharma with its assumptions and views**
- We assume we can strip off our beliefs and experience reality as it really is
	- What if we drop the assumption of what is reality?
- Dharma as art [[Talks - Questioning Awakening Rob Burbea#Dharma as Art]]
	- Creative, Desire, Play, Beauty, Not one truth
- Insight defined by its capacity to decrease dukkha
	- Practicing with insight as starting point

#### What is the point of practice?
- Up to each person to decide
- Many people don't fully articulate it to themselves

##### Fantasies in Meditation
- Medical Model (most common)
    - Meditating to heal
    - 4 Noble Truths â†’ Reducing suffering
    - Rest on many assumptions 
        - Primacy of brain functioning (materialist view of the world)
        - What reality is, what the world is
- Sense of Sacredness or Beauty (Artistic)
    - Seeing the practice as Art and doing it for its own sake
- Research Approach
    - Practicing to discover things about oneself or consciousness
- They can all co-exist at the same time in different proportion
- None of them is wrong
    - They can become constricting if taken too seriously
    - They are fantasies after all

- **The power of concepts, teachings and frameworks**
    - If no one ever introduced you to the possibility of sacredness, you may never experience it as it may not be in your framework
- **Medical model can become neutering or stagnant after some time**
	- Once suffering has been reduced the being wants other things
	- Erotic is often left out
		- Some people feel neutered by spiritual practice

#### Questioning Reality
- Reality seen as unquestionable (almost as a prison)
    - We have to learn to be ok with "what is"
- **Meditation can be a training to help us question the nature of reality**
    - Open the range of what we can perceive
- Different "[[Ways of Looking]]"
-  **Meditation as an infinite playground of infinite ways of looking at experience**
