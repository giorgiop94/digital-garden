## Main Concepts
- [[Ways of Looking]]
	- There are different ways of looking available to us which unfold different existences
	- **[[Meditation]] as an infinite playground of infinite ways of looking at experience**
	- [[Emptiness]]
	- Insight defined by its capacity to decrease dukkha
		- Practicing with insight as starting point
	- Any way of looking is fabricating reality
- Soulmaking Dharma
- Dharma as art â†’ [[Talks - Questioning Awakening Rob Burbea]]
	- Creative, Desire, Play, Beauty, Not one truth
- [[Goals in Spiritual Practice]]
- [[Pitfalls of Spiritual Frameworks]]
- **Our Modernist Worldview has impregnated the Dharma with its assumptions and views**
- We assume we can strip off our beliefs and experience reality as it really is
	- What if we drop the assumption of what is reality?
