The boundaries that should not be crossed for us to keep the Earth in its currently desirable state (Holocene)

Some of these boundaries show evidence of planetary scale [[Tipping point (nonlinear) effects]] and some do not. Those that don't show evidence of tipping points, however, are helpful in regulating and preventing tipping points of other boundaries.

There are strong **interactions** among the different boundaries. Transgressing one boundary may cause cascading effects on others

### CORE BOUNDARIES
Operate and regulate the entire Earth system, and they are the endpoint depending upon how the other boundaries operate.

1. [[Climate change]] (**TRANSGRESSED**)
	- Climate can get into glacial or extremely hot periods
	- *Control variable*: GHG Concentration
2. Biodiversity loss (**TRANSGRESSED**)
	- Biodiversity is key to regulating the Earth's functions and provision of [[Ecosystem Services]]
		- Pollinating bees and agriculture
		- Plant carbon sequestration
3. [[Chemical Pollution (Novel Substances)]]

### OTHER BOUNDARIES
4. [[Ocean acidification]]
	- Ocean can be in an oxygen rich state or oxygen free
5. [[Ozone Depletion]]
	- Necessary to protect biosphere from harmful radiations
6. Land and Water Use Change
	- 40% of land is used for agriculture and urban areas
		- Affect biodiversity and ecosystem services provision
	- 25% of large rivers no longer reach the ocean because we're taking out so much water
		- More water will be needed to feed a growing population
		- All biodiversity depends on water
7. Biogeochemical loading: Global [[Nitrogen and Phosphorus Cycle]] & [[Phosphorus Cycle]]
8. Global freshwater use
9. [[Aerosol Loading]]

### How Are Boundaries Measured?

- For each boundary we identify one or more control variable (e.g. GHG concentration)
- Then we look at what science says is the range of safety for that variable
- At which level will the variable cause a regime shift or start affecting other boundaries?
	- There's high uncertainty on those
	- The lowest bound of the range is considered (for precaution)
