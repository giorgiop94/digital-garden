title: Decision-Making
---
## Principles
- Do not take rushed decision (if decision requires you to be rushed and you can avoid taking the decision, avoid it) 
- [[Decision Journals]] help us mitigate some of the biases in our decisions
	- [[narrating self and experiencing self]]
- Look to falsify the beliefs you hold to be true to counter the [[Confirmation Bias]]
	- > "If that's not the way you are thinking you will not be successful, except by accident" - *[[Annie Duke]]*
	- Looking for the things we don't know can help us to deal with both of our information issues
		- The Information we have is limited and often wrong
	- [[Falsifiability]]
- Keep in mind [[Cognitive Biases]]


### Good Decisions vs Good Outcomes
- The two things are very different
	- We cannot assess decision quality objectively
		- Instead, we can assess the outcome of that decision
		- The problem is that we tend to mistake a good outcome with a good decision and viceversa

## Frameworks
- [[Hell Yeah or No]] vs. [[just say yes]]
- [[the map is not the territory (menu is not the food)]]
- [[What you want now vs what you want most]] 
- [[Collective Decision-Making]]
