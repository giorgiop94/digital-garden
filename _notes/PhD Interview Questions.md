### Some questions I was asked in a recent PhD Interview
- What challenges do you expect to face in this program and how do you plan to address them?
- Tell me about an experience where you faced a challenge in a research setting and how you addressed it
- What motivated you to apply to this program?
- Have you done research in areas related to food systems?
- Are you familiar with any research/data analysis software? How confident are you with them?
- Would you be confident putting together a research proposal? How would you structure it?
- Where do you see yourself in 10 years?
