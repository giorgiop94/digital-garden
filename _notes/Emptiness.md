- Things are empty of independent meaning or significance
	- All things without exception (including space and time and awareness) is empty of existing independent of the way you look at it - [[Rob Burbea]]
	- There is no inherent way things are
- **The way we perceive anything depends on our [[Ways of Looking]]**
	- e.g. When we practice [[Metta (Loving Kindness) Meditation]] thinking about a "neutral" or even negative person, we may suddenly start to see them as beautiful, radiating kindness etc...
