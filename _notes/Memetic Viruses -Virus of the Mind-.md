Ideas can infect people just like viruses and create some sort of psychological pandemic. As more people get infected it becomes easier and easier for the virus to spread as [[human minds are awfully malleable]]

Large scale examples are:
- Slavery (and the fact that everyone was ok with it)
- Capitalism
- Nazism
- Black Friday
- Everyone thinks that to be productive they must work in the same office
    - Driving 2 hours away from family. 
    - Before internet that was understandable now it seems to be more of a ritual or superstition 1.00

On a smaller scale, whenever someone is feeling a certain way they spread it to other people. They way people act is contagious if the other person is vulnerable.
- Anxiety
- [[Fear]]
- Anger

Mainstream media has a huge power to spread these kinds of viruses, but today with Social Media it is much easier for anyone to spread memetic viruses.

Now they are much easier to spread. 

- [[Propagative memes propagate more than true memes]]

- [[Protector memes help memes last longer]]
