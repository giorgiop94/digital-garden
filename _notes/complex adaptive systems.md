- A system consists of interconnected elements (agents) 
	- **It's more than the sum of its parts** (agents interact in nonlinear ways)
		- Elements are interconnected and interdependent
		- An element could be its own system with its own purpose, behavior and sub-systems
		- Each element may be changing all the time, making it difficult to predict their behavior or come up with definite solutions
	- No central control (self-organizing in a de-centralized way)
	- **Unpredictability**
		- [[Emergence]]
		- Hierarchical organization
		- Information processing
		- **Evolution and adaptation**

- Complexity
	- Fractal dimension (power laws)

- We cannot predict behavior of a system only based on its elements
- Different systems may respond differently to the same outside event
			- You could list elements and sub-elements indefinitely
				- **Important to identify the "boundaries" we want to consider for our system analysis** 

### Complex and Simple Problems
- Problems of simplicity involve a few variables
	- Temperature and pressure, population and time, current resistance and voltage
- Problems of Organized Complexity
	- moderate number of variables show strong nonlinear relationships (as opposed to simple problems)
- Problems of Disorganized Complexity 
	- millions/billions of variables show strong nonlinear relationships (as opposed to simple problems)

- complex systems will involve surprises
	- **[[more data and better models will not solve all uncertainties]]**
	- how do we act now based on what we know today?

	
### Examples
- Ant armies
	- Individual ant's behaviors is very simple, but when together they self-organize to produce a complex behavior
- Human brain - composed of simple cells (neurons)
- Networks
	- Financial Networks
	- Food Webs
	- Social Networks
