- [[Jhanas]] are different states arising from practice
- They are more available than one might think [[Rob Burbea]]

### Jhanas Description
1. **Pleasurable** sensations spreading throughout the body
	- Happiness in the background, goes unnoticed
	- Thoughts may still be there
2. Pleasurable sensations continue, **happiness** pervades the being
	- Mind can't follow thoughts (**thoughts are gone**)
3. Happiness becomes mellow, **contentment** arises
	- Profound sense of peaceful satisfaction
4. **Peacefulness** expands further, pervading everything
	- Mind and body dissolved in bright stillness
	- Sense of great aliveness in the moment
5. **Infinity of space** - Mystical sense of [[Oneness]]
6. **Infinity of consciousness**
7. **No-thingness**
	- Mind is still perceiving nothingness 
8. **Neither perception nor non-perception**
9. **Cessation** 

### Tips
- Not getting attached to any of it is really important
	- The ego can often get in the way, wants to wear it as a badge
	- [[Goals in Spiritual Practice]]
- To be considered as a lifetime commitment
- [[Rob Burbea]] usually introduces these ideas later in his student's practices
- Sometimes these states feel effortless, sometimes there is some tweaking that needs to be done

#### Risk of Escapism?
- Pleasure in practice can be seen as an escape
- It needs to be seen as one part of practice
	- Other parts involve being with one's negative feelings
- Practicing the Jhanas also helps us develop [[Love]] and confidence. It serves as healing for the body and mind
	- We realize we can be happy without needing anything
	- Helps us [[avoid greed and compulsive consumption]]
- Buddha talked about practicing Samadhi leads to [[Enlightenment]]


## Talk Five

- Concentration practices, can be seen as preparation for insight practices (vipassana)
	- As you go deeper you see that Samadhi and Vipassana feed each other and blend into each other

- Not a denial or running away from [[Emotions]]

### Benefits
- Reaching the [[Jhanas]]
- Develop
	- Confidence
	- Patience
	- Faith (in the practice)
	- Equanimity â†’ Be with everything that's happening
	- Willingness to renunciation (because you see you don't need anything to feel good)
- Sense of self ([[Ego]]) gets weaker
- Practice non-fabrication of stories by the mind
