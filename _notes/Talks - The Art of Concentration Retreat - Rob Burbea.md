## Talk One
- As Samadhi deepens it is supposed to lead to a sense of happiness, well-being and pleasure
	- Buddha placed large emphasis on it
- **Happiness leads to samadhi and viceversa** ([[Reinforcing Feedback Loops]])
- Meditation as an Art
	- No strict rules of how to respond
	- Sense of play

### Key Attitudes
- **Play**
	- Bringing play to practice every moment
	- Playing with the breath 
		- Our conception of the breath (feeling the breath coming out of our chest etc...)
		- Making breath as pleasurable as possible
- **Patience**
- Appreciation and gratitude
- Generosity
	- Reminding ourselves that we are practicing for the good of all beings

### For the Good of all Beings
- **==Creating a reservoir of pleasure and well being in practice allows us to let go and renounce material things==**
- We need less to be satisfied (food, entertainment, stuff)
- No need to be comfortable or security
- We become more available to others
	- Because we have enough
- The idea of renunciation is not scary anymore

### Not "Being with What Is"
- This practice encourages us to play with and manipulate the breath
	- This may feel not spiritual or not correct
	- Strong emphasis on being with what is
		- That kind of practice is not preparing us for daily life	
- In life we are constantly shaping and responding to things, we are not passively going through it
- **We manipulate the breath to make it as pleasurable as possible**

## Talk Four
- Description of [[Jhanas]]

### Risk of Escapism?
- Pleasure in practice can be seen as an escape
- It needs to be seen as one part of practice
	- Other parts involve being with one's negative feelings
- Practicing the Jhanas also helps us develop [[Love]] and confidence. It serves as healing for the body and mind
	- We realize we can be happy without needing anything
	- Helps us [[avoid greed and compulsive consumption]]
- Buddha talked about practicing Samadhi leads to [[Enlightenment]]

## Talk Five
- Concentration practices, can be seen as preparation for insight practices (vipassana)
	- As you go deeper you see that Samadhi and Vipassana feed each other and blend into each other

- Not a denial or running away from [[Emotions]]

### Benefits
- Reaching the [[Jhanas]]
- Develop
	- Confidence
	- Patience
	- Faith (in the practice)
	- Equanimity â†’ Be with everything that's happening
	- Willingness to renunciation (because you see you don't need anything to feel good)
- Sense of self ([[Ego]]) gets weaker
- Practice non-fabrication of stories by the mind
