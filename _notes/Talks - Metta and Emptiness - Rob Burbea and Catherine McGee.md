## Metta Practice
- [Intro to Metta Guided Meditation by Rob Burbea](https://dharmaseed.org/talks/12516)
### What is Metta?
Metta is an ideal love and well wishing that is unconditional and boundless. It embraces all beings independently of how they acted etc...

We gradually cultivate Metta by starting where it's easiest. It could be with ourselves, or with someone we deeply love.

There is not one specific feeling for Metta. It may manifest in many different feelings â†’ energy, warmth, joy, gentleness etc... If there's no feeling at all, that's completely fine too, we are planting seeds of Metta.

### Practicing Metta
- Different people have different preferred ways
- Some prefer cultivating Metta through phrases
	- Better to have 3 or 4 that you can easily remember
	- Better to keep them general and broad (applicable to everyone at any time)
	- Phrases not meant to be corrective - coming from a place of criticism - "May I be kind (because I'm not kind enough)"
		- Pay attention to that Energy should be about well wishing
	- Eventually phrases become not that important
		- The body itself becomes the center of practice
- Some through images or both
	- Imagining warmth or light radiating out of oneself and bathing others
	- Images don't need to be hi-fi, crystal clear
		- Important to get a sense of the images
	- Worth it to **play** around with different phrases and images see what works best for you
		- Sometimes you can stop saying the phrases and feel Metta in the body
		- Sometimes you can repeat a phrase twice, or say them more softly, or less frequently etc....
- Bringing **responsiveness** to the practice (responding skillfully to what's present in the moment)
	- #metaphor of sailing and responding to the situation (in [2nd guided meditation](https://dharmaseed.org/talks/12524))
		- If Metta is flowing well, we go with it and get nourished, enjoy it
		- If we notice some difficulty, we continue with Metta but make adjustments to deal with them (posture, light, images etc...)
		- We notice large difficulties, we respond by doing something different (take the sails down)
			- Try [[Focusing Practice]]
- Letting the Metta be expressed through touch
	- How often do we touch ourselves with tenderness?
	- Using one hand to touch the other
	- Opening the hands up and visualizing Metta coming out of it
	- Experiencing and expressing Metta through our lives, even to the inanimate objects

Sometimes, you will feel a sense of metta, warmth and kindness, open to it and enjoy it. But just like everything else, it will be impermanent. No need to be bothered by that when it's not there. **If we put too much pressure on ourselves to feel metta, we lose the sensitivity to notice subtler sensations**.

Element of **faith**([[The 5 Heroic Motivations]]), we are planting the seeds with the phrases, knowing that they will eventually sprout (even if we don't feel it flowing right now)

### Using Samadhi to Cultivate Metta
- We can start practicing with phrases and images to cultivate a sense of Metta in the body
- Or we can start by cultivating pleasurable ([[Samadhi]]) states in the body, and then interpreting them as Metta and spreading it to others
- Discussed in the [Fourth Guided Instructions](https://dharmaseed.org/talks/12519)

### Metta Q&A
- Practicing Metta throughout the day, while walking etc...
	- Wishing well to the people we come across


## Talk - Freeing the Self
### Summary on Emptiness
- There's suffering and causes of suffering
	- Craving and clinging are common causes for craving
	- **We crave and cling because of a deep misunderstanding about who we are, and how the world is**
	- We don't see the emptiness of thing, the dependent co-arising
- Emptiness is sometimes taught as the "teaching of disappointment"
	- Everything becomes meaningless, nihilism
- In reality there's a strong sense of beauty and meaning that can come from it 
- Emptiness is a tool for freedom
	- It is a way of looking that we pick up and put down
	- It is complementary to the "View of Self"
		- We can learn to use the "View of Self" as another freeing, useful tool
	- Both can be true

### Emptiness of Self
- **Starting with Emptiness of Self is a good way to learn about emptiness without running the risk of facing nihilism or meaninglessness**
- We identify with our personality, our body, or even with awareness
- Often we have negative self-identifications
	- Can we see that those are not true?
- Positive self-definitions can be a good stepping stone, but eventually also lead to suffering and are not true
	- We have to constantly prove our self-worth to others
- However we define ourselves, our definition is not going to ALWAYS hold true
	- If it is not always true, we cannot say it to be true 
- **==Emptiness of Self doesn't mean there's an erasure of personality==**
	- Are we moving to normalcy and conformity?
	- **==Emptiness means we are free to express our individuality==**

#### Practicing with Self-Definitions
- Starting with suffering, notice how you are defining yourself or others (worthless, weak, wounded, sick passionate etc...)
	- Realize that that definition is empty
	- Ask: "What do I repeat to myself (or others) about myself?"
- [[Confirmation Bias]] creates [[Reinforcing Feedback Loops]] where we look for confirmations of our definitions
	- We get stuck believing our definitions more and more strongly
- Some of these self-definitions might be partially true
	- **How are these definitions bounding, limiting, constraining the possibility of our Self?**
- Reification blocks love
	- **If we feel a stronger sense of love as we let go of our self-reification, it's a sign that we are on the right track**
- We can expand, open up our self-view by honoring and loving the fullness of self
	- All the manifestations, parts of our self
- "What do I overlook about my Self?"
	- We often only focus n the self-definitions we acknowledge, while ignoring many other **beautiful** parts of our self

#### Practicing with Sense of Self
- Sense of Self is different from self-definitions or thoughts about self
	- It is more about how your self **feels**
	- Feelings of lack, or desire, shame etc...
- Every mindstate has a *body-sense* and a *self-sense* 
- **Paying attention to our sense of self throughout the day, as we practice etc...**
	- Is the sense of self getting more contracted or expanded?
	- Does sending love to oneself in Metta reinforce/contract the sense of Self?
		- **Try it!**
- Can we allow our self to feel a self sense that we usually don't allow?
	- What is it like to feel vulnerable or strong, if we usually avoid them?

## Talk - Holding Yourself Dear
- How do we talk to ourselves?
	- We do it all the time
	- We might as well be kind to ourselves
	- [[Positive Self-Talk]]
- Taking it as a practice and playing with it
	- Talking nice to ourselves as we go through our day
	- Treating yourself as a 
		- Special guest
		- child who needs care
		- Loved one
- Looking again at ourselves
	- Looking while accepting [[Not-knowing]] everything about our self
	- Not defining and limiting who we think ourselves to be

### Exercise
- Questions to journal about #journalingprompts 
- What's right about not holding yourself dear?
- What are you afraid would happen if you treated yourself as the beloved one?
	- Not asking to the wise part of yourself
- What hinders you from holding yourself dear?
- What is it like to hold yourself dear?
	- What does it feel like?

### (Perceived) Issues with Self-kindness
- In society, people who like or love themselves aare often looked at with suspicion or contempt
- Near enemy of Love
	- Attached, clinging love
- Far enemy
	- Hatred and aversion (even towards love itself)
	- Metta practice may allow us to see the hatred more clearly
		- Aversion to hatred may immediately arise in response
		- Instead we can also hold the hatred and aversion in a loving container
		- Love is capable of doing that

## Talk - Ending Blame
- Blame blocks love, whether towards ourselves, others or both
- Recognizing the causes and conditions behind all events, actions etc... helps us reduce our self-blame or others' blame
	- "I made a mistake because I was tired, my boss was breathing on my neck and many other conditions"
	- Allows more love to flow
	- Opens a self-view that's more in line with emptiness
- The way we see things is the fundamental thing that gets us in trouble
	- Avijja = Ignorance/Delusion
	- At lots of different levels we have a wrong view that hurts us
- Unconsciously we interpret events or emotions as meaning something about our self
	- e.g. "I'm feeling sad, it must mean I'm a failure" (it may also be non-verbalized thoughts, or images that we interpret in some ways)
	- These thoughts crystallize the self
- **We practice deliberately changing/flipping the view**
	- Of oneself, of other people, of our lives etc...
	- Changing from a view of "how I feel, what I need" to "how can I support others?"
- Metta softens our view, making it more flexible and malleable

## Talk - Contact and Construction of the Self
- **When there is suffering, there is fabrication of the self"

### Dealing with Fabrication
- Seeing that the Self is fabricated
- Seeing how it is fabricated
- Learning to fabricate it less

### Learning to fabricate it less
- Stop feeding the views that are fabricating ("She treated Me this way")
- Simplifying attention
	- Fabrication makes the mind spin agitatedly
	- Focus on the simple present, allowing the unpleasantness (we might have aversion to it)

### Practice of "Staying at Contact"
- Practicing "bare attention"
	- Coming back to the bareness of sensations
	- No labels, no fabrication of the mind
	- If labels come up, just coming back to sensations
		- **In a way labeling also creates the experience**
			- If you label a sensation as "pain", you also fabricate a self experiencing the pain
			- You compare yourself to others who seem to have no pain
			- The experience may become more painful than if you labeled it as "warmth"
- We can systematically practice with different senses (sight, hearing, touch, smell, thoughts)
	- Looking only at thoughts might be tricky, easy to get distracted
- It can be easier to look at thoughts while keeping a spacious awareness of all sensations that come up
- We may find a sense of relief, or find a sense of beauty in the rawness of sensations
